Dialog will be shown on the screen from the begining. Use the ENTER key to scroll the dialog. Eventually, options will be shown in the the top right corner of the screen.

There will be an option as to which play style you would like.
Player vs Computer: This style will let you play against a computer with a random pokemon. The computer will also use random moves.
Player vs Player: This style allows two human players to choose Pokemon and battle for the title of pokemon master!
Computer vs Computer: If you don't want to fight but would rather watch a match, choose this option to watch computers randomly choose pokemon and attacks.

When the option is available for chosing your pokemon, a list of 6 pokemon will appear. Scroll through the list and choose the one that looks the strongest based on its type, attacks, and strengths. There are no tips on which one to choose. Try them all out and pick you favorite!

A battle sequence will begin. The objective of the battle is to drop the opponent's pokemon to 0 hp before your pokemon does. The fastest pokemon will get to attack first. There are 3 types of moves: healing, attacking, and effect. Healing moves will give your pokemon more hp. Attacking moves will attempt to damage the other pokemon but have a chance to miss. The effect moves can either increase your pokemon's stats or decrease the opponent's.

To choose a move, use all four arrow keys to point to the most appealing attack. Press the ENTER key to make your choice. A message will be displayed to let the user know if it was a success or failure.

When the battle is over, a winner will be declared. You may choose to play again if you like.
