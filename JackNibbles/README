JackNibbles - README

JackNibbles is a variant of the Nibbles(Qbasic version of Snake) that I have decided to
create.  This was the first game I ever played on a computer and it's always had a 
special place in my heart.  

My original plan was to have an almost exact replica of the Nibbles game.  Well
I quickly found out that I would not have color but that did not deter me.  I 
figured the best way for me to start would be get my game start and game over 
screens working properly.  Then I would move on to snake movement, number blocks,
collisions and then maybe add some obstacles.  I never got past snake movement.  
I spent quite a bit of time trying to get the snake movement working correctly 
but ended up using the the example square as a template for snake movement.  I 
could never get the snake to be drawn correctly no matter what I did to draw the
rectangle.  I decided to adapt the same blob model as the SnakeLike game in git 
repository https://github/ybakos/csci498-games2011 because I was running out of 
time and had other homework and projects to get done.  Overall I like what I 
finished up with but feel a little defeated that I couldn't actually get the 
fluid snake movement that I was looking for.

The JackNibbles directory contains:
Main.jack
JackNibbles.jack // Modified from Square and SnakeLike
Blob.jack  	 // Modified from SnakeLike
Snake.jack 	 // Modified from Square and SnakeLike
Random.jack 	 // Create by Taylor Whacker and Connor McKay and used with permission

Usage is:

Game play will begin with a relatively slow moving snake at some random part of the
screen. It is then up to the player to maneuver the snake around using the A(left), 
S(down), W(up), D(right) or corresponding arrow keys. The goal is to gather number 
blocks(blobs) while avoiding itself and the screen edges.  If the player is lucky enough 
to get 15 blocks, then the player will declared a winner, while anything less is 
considered a failure.
