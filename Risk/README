This directory contains all necessary files for RISK.

To play the game, open the entire folder in the VM Emulator.

Gameplay directions are displayed on the screen. Note that Player 1 is white and Player 2 is black.

Notes:

Version 1.0 Does Not Support:
1) Checking to see if the player is adding armies to their own territory
2) Input error checking (e.g. if a user enters A for number of armies to add, it breaks)
3) Checking to see if player is attacking a neighboring territory
4) Algorithm for determining number of armies received (based on territories owned and continents held) - currently defaults to 3
5) Full board (more territories to be added in Version 2.0

Twists
1) You lose your turn if you try to attack from your opponent's territory
2) You lose your ability to place armies for that turn if you try to place more than you have (cheaters never win)

Enjoy!
